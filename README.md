This repository contains my development environment that I use for school and work.
Feel free to copy my dotfiles or leave suggestions!

## Colour Scheme ([Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin))

The common theme across all my applications! I use the **Mocha** flavour.

## Editor ([Neovim](https://neovim.io))

A sweet command-based editor that speeds up coding.
Even if you don't want to use Neovim, I recommend getting a Vim bindings plugin in an editor like VSCode.
All of my config for Neovim is under `src/nvim`.
I use [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to manage plugins.

<details><summary>Awesome plugins</summary>

- `mason.nvim`: LSP manager
- `nvim-treesitter`: Improved syntax highlighting
- `nvim-cmp`: Code completion engine
- `copilot.lua`: GitHub Copilot for faster coding
- `lspsaga.nvim`: Improved LSP commands
- `conform.nvim` & `nvim-lint`: Formatting and linting

- `harpoon`: Quick navigation

## Terminal ([kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty))

I use [fish](https://fishshell.com) to make using the CLI easier.
[Starship](https://starship.rs) gives a clean look to the prompt!

## Tiling Compositor ([Hyprland](https://hyprland.org))

Tiling windows means I can navigate quickly and effortlessly to what I need.
I recommend compiling a list of keybinds that you find easy to remember and use.
I previously used [XMonad](https://xmonad.org); its configs are under the `archive/xmonad` branch.

## Managing dotfiles ([Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager))

I dislike having a system that requires mental gymnastics to understand.
Home Manager allows for a declarative approach to installing and configuring software.
For instance, all the packages on my system are in `home.packages`, so I can know what's installed at a glance.
Most of my setup can be found in `home.nix`!
